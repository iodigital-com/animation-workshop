# Types of Animations
- Component behavior
- Micro-interactions 
<!--
Component animation/behaviors are how specific components or component sets are animated and adjusted, either individually or in relation to one another, within specific usage contexts (this can vary depending upon the framework your team may be working with).

# Micro-interactions

::left::
- Provide visual feedback to user
- Possible to explain a lot without using a word

# Transition vs Animation <MarkerCss />

| **Transition** | **Animation** |
| --- | --- |
| Can't loop | Loop all you want |
| Needs trigger | Just starts |
| Easy to control from JS | Very complex |
| Animate from A to B | Multiple props and timeframes |

# Business value
::left::
- Usually underprioritized due to lack of "business value"
- Truth is it can indirectly bring a lot of it:
    - Encouraging engagement
    - Displaying system status
    - Providing error prevention
    - Communicating brand
::right::

- Big psychological factor
- We visual-makers have a lot of power

# Dont't abuse
::left::
- Take care of your users
- Overwhelming animations can bring stress and achieve the opposite effect
- Your app is not the only one claiming for engagement
